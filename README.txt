GoalKeeper is an application for setting goals with end dates. The Java application will email or text the user an alert when the alloted time is up. 

To project requires the JavaMail API (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html)'s mail.jar file, which may be downloaded from the site. 

To compile, run javac -classpath .:/Users/mewsicalcat/Documents/javamail-1.4.5/mail.jar GoalTest.java (replacing the argument to -classpath with the location of mail.jar). 

To run, invoke "java GoalTest".
